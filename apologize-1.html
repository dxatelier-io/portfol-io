        The evening arrived like a letter with no stamp, delivered, somehow, without permission.
        I stood at the threshold of our shared silence, counting the soft hums of the city as if
        they were apologies you never said out loud. The window kept a halo of warm light on the floor,
        and i traced it with my toes, pretending it was a map back to the moment we forgot how to be gentle.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        If i had known that leaving is a language with too many synonyms, i would've memorized them all.
        Instead, i held on to fragments... the chipped mug, the lilac scrunchie on the chair, your name
        written like a constellation in the margins of my notebook. They made a galaxy small enough
        to fit in my pocket, but still too heavy to carry without bending.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        This is not a grand trial. I don’t want your confession, your theatre of regrets, your late night
        epiphanies. I want the simple verb you kept behind your teeth. I want the softest truth...
        at least, apologize to me.
      </p>
