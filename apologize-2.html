      <h1 class="h1">The Small Loud Things</h1>
      <div class="h2">How teacups, calendars, and door hinges remember</div>

      <p class="p">
        The first thing that learned to speak after you left was the door. It sighed each time i opened it,
        as if rehearsing the sound of your shoes turning back. Then the calendar began to cough up
        dates with your initials—timid reminders scrawled in bubble letters <em>"call back</em>,
        <em>bring peach jam</em>, <em>check plants"</em>. The basil obeyed you more than the sun, it drooped
        like a reprimand when i watered it too late.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        I discovered that the house had a pulse. It tapped beneath the tiles at midnight, shuffled
        in the drawers where we hid our spare keys and our egos. Even the teacups chimed when i stacked
        them, a porcelain choir humming a chorus of almost-okay. None of it was dramatic. None of it
        was enough to drown out the quiet. But it was something—small loud things, refusing to be invisible.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        If apologies are bridges, then i’ve been placing planks... a message drafted and unsent, a voice note
        deleted, a memory dusted and arranged on the mantle. I don't know if the river will cooperate.
        I only know the opposite of drowning is not always swimming. Sometimes it is naming the water.
