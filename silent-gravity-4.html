      <div class="h2">How I stood without chasing</div>

      <p class="p">
        I still wait without chase. Even after you left and hurt me that much, there exists in me a doorway
        that opens without demand. If you came back with the clumsy language of remorse, i would not
        collapse or throw myself into an embrace with feverish gratitude. I would stand, take your coat,
        and offer tea. Because waiting, for me, has become an art of edges, to be present without becoming
        the only thing that keeps you from moving.
      </p>

      <p class="p">
        If you return, i will open the door. Not because i think you will always stay, but because i once
        loved what you showed me of light, and the bridge you cross will not be empty. I will light a small
        lamp, not to beg you in, but to show you that a room can remember warmth and still be honest.
