      <p class="p">
        Tonight, i lit small lanterns along the handrails of the bridge. They looked like commas,
        soft pauses in a sentence that was learning not to run. I stood at the center and practiced hello,
        then practiced a silence that wasn’t a wall. The water below kept repeating itself, patient
        and glittering, as if to say that some stories can be reread without breaking.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        If you come here, you’ll find the path is already sanded smooth. I’ve left room for your footsteps, not as a surrender, but as an invitation to be human with me again. Bring no ceremony. Bring only
        the word that is both a bandage and a beginning. Bring it small, if you must. Bring it late.
        But bring it.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        And if you cannot, i will keep the lanterns anyway. I will walk home slowly, counting the light
        as proof that i built something tender out of the ache. I will write the date in the margin,
        fold the page, and place it near the kettle. Tomorrow, i will learn a new synonym for staying.
