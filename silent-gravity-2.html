        We collected nights like seashells—each one a curve that fit into my palm,
each one carrying the sound of your voice when it lowered and turned into weather.
        There were nights when we belonged only to each other, because it was just us on the bed.
There were mornings when i still saw your bare face inside me, after the nights we spent together.
      </p>

      <p class="p">
        Your silent gravity pulled at the edges of my day. Small things, an unfinished cup, the
        indentation of your shoulder on a cushion—gathered into a catalog i read often by lamp light.
        I learned the way you folded warmth into the quiet. Later, i catalogued its absence.
