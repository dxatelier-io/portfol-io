      <p class="p">
        And even now, after everything, i find myself walking the same late streets,
        tracing the hollows where your laughter used to fit. Night folds in around me like
        someone tucking a blanket close, the city becomes a careful witness. I think of
        the way you moved across rooms like a secret, small and certain, and i wonder how
        a body can remember another body with such arithmetic, the elbow against the counter,
        the breath on a cold morning.
      </p>

      <p class="p">
        There is a memory in me of your hands catching light—soft, patient. There is a memory
        of a smile that ruined the quiet i had been protecting. I didn't know then that a smile
        could be a geography i would keep returning to, compassless and unafraid.
