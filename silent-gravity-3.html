      <div class="h2">Of lips, eyes, and the ruin of ordinary days</div>

      <p class="p">
        You had soft lips that learned how to say small mercies and not the loud apologies
        i once imagined. Your eyes—pretty, distracted, like pages from a book i wanted to own—
        held light in a way that made my sentences stumble. When you smiled, lawlessness arrived
        without warning, the careful scaffolding of my plans would loosen, and i would allow myself
        to drift into the orbit of that smile, which was both invitation and exquisite sabotage.
      </p>

      <p class="p">
        I remember thinking, once, that love was a weather pattern. It came and it left, forecasts
        were weak promises. Then you left, and the world learned a new climate on my skin. Still,
        even in the quiet, i find the geometry of your face mapped in small gestures, how you folded
        the corner of a page, how you traced the rim of your mug with a thumb.
